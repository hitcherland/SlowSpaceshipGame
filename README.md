# Installation

To modify this unity file, you'll need to have Unity 2018.4.16f1 (a.k.a Unity 2018.4.16 LTS) installed. 
You can install it using Unity Hub, or by downloading the exact build.
[Here's a link to Unity's download page](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download)

If you're not using Windows x64, you should adjust the protobuf path at "Edit > Preferences > Protobuf > Path to protoc" as appropriate.
This repo already includes Google.Protobuf.Tools so you should be able to point yourself to the relevant nearby directory.
